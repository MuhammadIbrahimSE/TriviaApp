## Code insights

### Used  Libraries(frameworks)
->[MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) most efficient architecture for android applications.
->[Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) A dependency injection framework
->[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) Used for networking

## What has been made:
1: Selection screen for type, level and category of questions.
2: A quick mode where user get only 5 seconds for each question.
## What are issues:
1: No proper logical track of user score.
2: User cannot see result.
3: If user does not select any option, first option is selected by default.

## Suggestions:
1: The current app is more focused on implementation rather than the UI. So, UI can be improved.
2: UX needs to be improved(next button placement)
3: Constraint for selecting the point manually rather than selecting its first option by default.
